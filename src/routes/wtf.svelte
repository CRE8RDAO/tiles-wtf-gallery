	<h1>tiles.wtf?</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/tankbottoms/tiles-on-chain">infinite tiles v2 (on-chain)</a>, as the
		name suggests, is an on-chain reversed engineered re-implementation of
		<a href="https://twitter.com/peripheralist">@peripheralist</a>â€™s
		<a href="https://github.com/TileDAO">Tiles experiment</a>, the
		<a href="https://juicebox.money/#/p/tiles">2nd project on juicebox v1</a>. this project is a
		homage to the venerable
		<a href="https://twitter.com/peripheralist"
			>@peripheralist, the genius artist, designer, developer, grapher, person</a
		>. "all hail @peripheralist, we worship the ground you walk on," thinking everyone.
	</p>
	<p>
		in keeping with the spirit, and vibe of juicebox and the tiles community, upon the infinite
		tiles v2 mainnet launch, the juicebox project nft, and presumably its corresponding ens will be
		transferred to a gnosis. in addition to the minting application, the infinite tiles website
		implements its own functional treasury application for ongoing direct contributions, governance
		token emissions, and funding cycle configuration. this would possibly serve as an example or
		option for communities seeking their own dao solution; a completely on-chain nft offering
		coupled with advanced treasury management, this infinite tiles v2 project serves as an option to
		the community.
	</p>
	<p>
		the tiles v2 <a href="https://github.com/tankbottoms/tiles-on-chain">wtf-nft</a> and
		<a href="https://github.com/tankbottoms/tiles-wtf-gallery">wtf-gallery</a> repo hopes to enable both
		highly curated experience and significantly decentralize the front-end.
	</p>
	<p>
		the og <a href="https://tiles.art">tiles</a> owners obviously mint for free, in the entertaining
		event an another individual has minted your tile of an ethereum address you control, you will be
		presented with the option to repossess the tile according to the pricing schedule, this is called
		seizing.
	</p>
	<p>
		the v2 <a href="https://github.com/tankbottoms/tiles-on-chain/blob/main/contracts/TileNFT.sol">
			nft source</a
		>, may shorten development time for similiarly styled designs. the specific tile design
		huerestic may be found
		<a
			href="https://github.com/tankbottoms/tiles-on-chain/blob/main/contracts/components/TileContentProvider.sol"
			>here</a
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		while no concrete decisions have been made, the general sentiment is for the v2 proceeds to be
		divided or accumilated and granted to new v2 Juicebox treasuries or communities via some
		strategy, ideally some token of appreciation be awarded to @peri, such as a tile tattoo gift
		certificate, or tile-themed-IRL-tchotchke. whichever, suggestions are welcome.

#### about

Tiles v2 is an on-chain re-implementation of [@peripheralist](https://twitter.com/peripheralist)â€™s [tilesdao](https://github.com/TileDAO) the [second project on Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/#/p/tiles). The project is an homage to the venerable @peripheralist, the genius artist, developer, person.

[Tiles v2 on chain](https://github.com/tankbottoms/tiles-on-chain) contains the re-implementation. The contract structure employed follows a composable pattern which will be familiar with anyone involved in the Juicebox NFT minting toolkit. The Tile contract uses Juicebox v2 ProjectPayer (https://info.juicebox.money/docs/protocol/build/utilities/project-payer) as its transparent treasury.

Original Tiles v1 token holders may mint their token for free (sans gas), if someone has preemptively minted another individual's address, a small premium would be required to seize the token.

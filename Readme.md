#### manifesto

Tiles v2 is an on-chain re-implementation of [@peripheralist](https://twitter.com/peripheralist)â€™s [tilesdao](https://github.com/TileDAO) the [second project on Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/#/p/tiles). The project is an homage to the venerable @peripheralist, the genius artist, developer, person.

A number of token drop mechanics are under consideration including method of distribution, pricing tiers, tier widths, and NFT minters and the DAO. The Tile contract uses Juicebox v2 ProjectPayer (https://info.juicebox.money/docs/protocol/build/utilities/project-payer) as its transparent treasury.
